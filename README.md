## About The Project

GPTDriver is a Python library developed to simplify the process of interacting with OpenAI's ChatGPT model. With GPTDriver, you can control ChatGPT through command lines, allowing for easy integration and seamless communication with the language model.

ChatGPT, powered by OpenAI, is a state-of-the-art language model capable of generating human-like text based on prompts provided to it. However, interacting with the ChatGPT user interface manually can be cumbersome and time-consuming. GPTDriver aims to streamline this process by leveraging Selenium, a web automation framework, to emulate human navigation through the ChatGPT website.

Rather than relying on the OpenAI API key for direct access to ChatGPT, GPTDriver automates the browser interactions required to communicate with the model. This approach provides a more convenient way to interact with ChatGPT and eliminates the need for handling HTTP requests or managing API keys.

By using Selenium, GPTDriver mimics human behavior while navigating the ChatGPT website. It can log in to your OpenAI account, create new chat sessions, send prompts, and retrieve responses, all through command lines. This approach provides a natural and intuitive way to control ChatGPT and integrate it into your Python projects.

Key features of GPTDriver include:

* Simple command line interface for controlling ChatGPT.
* Emulation of human navigation through the ChatGPT website using Selenium.
* Automated login process for OpenAI account authentication.
* Ability to create new chats and maintain multiple chat sessions.
* Seamless sending of prompts to ChatGPT and retrieving responses.
* ~~Support for customization, including chat history and system messages.~~

GPTDriver aims to empower developers and researchers by providing a user-friendly and efficient way to leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT. With GPTDriver, you can harness the power of ChatGPT's natural language processing by emulating human interactions with the ChatGPT user interface.
